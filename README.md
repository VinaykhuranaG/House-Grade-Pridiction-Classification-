# House-Grade-Pridiction-Classification-
 Build a predictive model to determine the Grade of  house (The grades are A, B, C, D, and E).
Here I did some process like Missing value treatment, Label encoder, EDA, Scaling and other preprocessing. After some preprocessing I used Classification algorithm 
(Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest) for Prediction 
and trained the model after that I compared the model and find out best model 
for prediction.
